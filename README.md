# DeFi Contract

ERC20 contract unveils ERC20 token named "KanaramMlai" (KM), alongside a Vault contract. 
KM adheres rigorously to the ERC20 standard for decentralized transactions, ensuring seamless total supply tracking, balance management, and event handling for transfers and approvals. 
Interfacing with KM via the IERC20 interface, the Vault contract furnishes users with a robust platform to deposit and withdraw funds securely, earning shares commensurate with their contributions.

## Steps:

1. Create Avalanche Subnet: Run the following command to create an Avalanche subnet named "Mali":

    avalanche subnet create Mali

2. Deploy Subnet: Deploy the subnet using the command:

    avalanche subnet deploy Mali

3. Connect to MetaMask: Ensure that MetaMask, a cryptocurrency wallet and gateway to blockchain apps, is connected to the Avalanche network to interact with smart contracts and deploy transactions securely.

4. Run ERC20.sol and Vault.sol: Deploy the ERC20 token contract (ERC20.sol) and the Vault contract (Vault.sol) onto the Avalanche network. These contracts will handle the functionality of the KanaramMali (KM) token and the Vault, respectively, facilitating secure transactions and fund management for users.
